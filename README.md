# ENDIG

This is the repository for ENDIG, the European Notifiable Diseases Interactive Geovisualization.

## Source Code

This repository holds is the full source code of

-   the ENDIG web application
-   the scripts needed to download and process the required data

In order to try ENDIG on your own machine, you will need [R](https://cran.org) with the packages `shiny`, `sf`, and `ggplot2` installed. It is highly recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
