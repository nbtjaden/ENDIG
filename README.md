# Using ENDIG

Dear reviewers!
Unfortunately, blind peer review prevents us from offering you the online version of ENDIG on shinyapps.io to explore. We can, however, offer you this anonymized GitHub repository of the complete source code.

In order to try ENDIG on your own machine, you will need [R](https://cran.org) with the packages `shiny`, `sf`, and `ggplot2` installed. It is highly recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Please download and unpack `ENDIG_for_local_testing.zip`, the archive contains the ENDIG application and all necessary data. Open `ENDIG.R` in RStudio - a click on "Run App" at the top right of the source code panel should start ENDIG for you to explore.
